                        Perhaps the most dangerous of all, this stone has a mind and a hunger that only souls can satisfy. It allows its owner to steal, 
                        subdue and change the souls of the living or the dead. Ironically, the stone is the gateway to an idyllic pocket universe.

                    <td>
                        The stone gives its owner full power over time. It makes the past, present and future accessible or visible. 
                        A master of the stone can use its power as a weapon, trapping enemies or even entire worlds in endless time loops. 
                        The stone can also cause objects and beings to physically revert to a young age or age.

                    <td>The stone allows its owner to exist in any surrounding space, whether it be space or underwater depths; move objects, yourself 
                        and other creatures to any corner of the universe; deform and rebuild space.</td>

                        The most destructive of all. The stone allows you to increase the power of consciousness of the owner and gain access to the 
                        thoughts and dreams of other beings. With the support of the Stone of Power, with its help it is possible to gain access to all 
                        existing minds at the same time. The stone can also release inner demons, whatever they may be in other universes, 
                        and drive them back.

                        The only stone that was in a fluid state. It allows its owner to fulfill any desires, even if these desires are contrary 
                        to scientific laws. If used carelessly, the stone can lead to disaster. By touching the edge of reality, it causes catastrophic 
                        damage that can only be isolated by the power of the Space Stone, the Soul Stone, and the Power Stone.

                        The stone has access to all the power and energy that has ever existed or exists in the future, nourishes other stones and 
                        enhances their effects. The stone allows the wearer to duplicate almost any physical superhuman ability and become invulnerable, 
                        and therefore invincible, using sheer strength alone.
